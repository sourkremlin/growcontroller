GUI Framework
-------------

Kivy seems the obvious choice. Notes on setup and integration with the official touchscreen are [here](https://github.com/mrichardson23/rpi-kivy-screen). Nice video presentation is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eah3Zq18OyM)

Testing
-------

pytest because I like it. Hardware interfaces to the RPi can be mocked with the [fake-rpi module](https://pypi.org/project/fake-rpi/)
